**SQL and PYTHON-Supply Chain Analysis**
#INTRODUCTION
***Disclaimer:*** The results of this analysis are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution. The dataset requires further cleaning to address inconsistencies and missing values. Additionally, more data should be collected to ensure a comprehensive and reliable analysis.
In this analysis, we explored several key aspects of the company’s product sales and inventory management to uncover actionable insights. By leveraging the company’s dataset, which contains data on product types, sales, inventory, customer demographics, and more, we aimed to address the following questions:
**How do lead times affect stock levels and product availability?**
We examined how fluctuations in lead times (the time taken for products to be replenished) influence stock levels and the availability of products. Understanding this relationship is critical for improving supply chain efficiency and ensuring products are available to customers when needed.
